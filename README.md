# covid-prisons

The Marshall Project is a nonprofit investigative newsroom dedicated to the U.S. criminal justice system. Recently, they reported on the spread of Covid-19 in US prisons. Using their publicly available data, I've created graphics to shed light on the virus's spread in our state prison systems.

Check out the visualizations [here](https://william-rice.github.io/covid-prisons/).

This [Jupyter notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/william-rice/covid-prisons/blob/main/map_viz.ipynb) has the Python code for building the maps. And this [Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/b7270f33fc7cf19c) has the D3 code for building the comparison visualization. 

Here's the Marshall Project's original article: ["A State-by-State Look at Coronavirus in Prisons"](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/01/a-state-by-state-look-at-coronavirus-in-prisons)
